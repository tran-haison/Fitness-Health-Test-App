      "goal": "Brain disease prediction",
      "description": "First, stand up straight with two feet, then bring one leg back and tilt it at a 90-degree angle to the other. Stay in this position for 60 seconds. Or close your eyes then stay in 20 seconds.",

      "disease_analysis": "If you can't do this test, it means you have a high risk of heart problems. It is because your body is too \"stiff\" that your hands cannot reach your feet.
